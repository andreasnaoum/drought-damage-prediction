# Deep Learning for Drought Damage Prediction Using Smartphone Images of Crops

## Data Sources 
The project exclusively uses data from the "Eyes on the Ground" Challenge, consisting of 26,068 labeled training images and 8,663 testing images. The dataset was contributed by smallholder farmers making insurance claims.

## Data Analysis and Preprocessing
The methodology includes an analysis of the dataset to extract insights, preprocessing techniques such as image resizing and normalization, and the transformation of categorical data. Training, validation, and test sets were created for model development.

## Convolutional Neural Network
A CNN architecture, inspired by successful image processing tasks, was implemented using TensorFlow. The network is trained to predict the percentage of drought damage in processed images. Model assessment is based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric.
